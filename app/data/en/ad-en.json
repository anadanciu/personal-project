I constantly strive to learn fast, adapt to new challenges, and keep my motivation high. At the same time, working with a team of professionals brings me a lot of excitement, because together we can deliver creative solutions that last and have a positive impact on society. I am a well-organized person with proven problem-solving abilities and with excellent communication skills.  My core belief is that if I really desire to succeed, I will find a way.

            I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript(ES6), JQuery and I have experience with:
             - SASS, Bootstrap, for responsive and scalable designs and mobile optimization, cross-browser compatibility issues and solutions;
             - performance and optimization problems, and a demonstrated ability to both diagnose and prevent these;
             - web development best practices (BEM naming convention in CSS, Lint, etc);
            - NPM package manager for managing dependencies and build processes;
            - Git version control;
            - Agile methodology, Jira, and Confluence for project management, working very closely with designers, back-end developers, and QA teams;
            - popular UI web frameworks like Angular, Vue, and lately React, which has become my frontend framework of choice in tackling new challenges.",
